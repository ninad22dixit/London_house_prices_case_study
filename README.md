# Springboard Projects
London house prices case study is the first guided project of the Springboard Data Science program.
London consists of 32 boroughs (districts) - some of them more desirable than others, which is reflected in their average housing prices.
The question addressed in this project is: which boroughs of London have seen the greatest increase in housing prices, on average, over the last two decades (1998-2018)?

The data was extracted from the following url: "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/uk-house-price-index/70ac0766-8902-4eb5-aab5-01951aaed773/UK%20House%20price%20index.xls", which is stored in MS Excel format.

This case utilizes learning from Units 1-4 of the Springboard Data Science program that include:
1. pandas

    a. data ingestion and inspection (pandas Foundations, Module One)
  
    b. exploratory data analysis (pandas Foundations, Module Two)
  
    c. tidying and cleaning (Manipulating DataFrames with pandas, Module Three)
  
    d. transforming DataFrames (Manipulating DataFrames with pandas, Module One)
  
    e. subsetting DataFrames with lists (Manipulating DataFrames with pandas, Module One)
  
    f. filtering DataFrames (Manipulating DataFrames with pandas, Module One)
  
    g. grouping data (Manipulating DataFrames with pandas, Module Four)
  
    h. melting data (Manipulating DataFrames with pandas, Module Three)
  
    i. advanced indexing (Manipulating DataFrames with pandas, Module Four)
  
2. matplotlib (Intermediate Python for Data Science, Module One)
3. fundamental data types (Data Types for Data Science, Module One)
4. dictionaries (Intermediate Python for Data Science, Module Two)
5. handling dates and times (Data Types for Data Science, Module Four)
6. function definition (Python Data Science Toolbox - Part One, Module One)
7. default arguments, variable length, and scope (Python Data Science Toolbox - Part One, Module Two)
8. lambda functions and error handling (Python Data Science Toolbox - Part One, Module Four)
